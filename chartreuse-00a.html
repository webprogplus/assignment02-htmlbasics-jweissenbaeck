<p>Chartreuse (Yellow-green) </p>

<p>Chartreuse is a color midway between yellow & green that was named due of its resemblance to the green color <br>
of one of the French liqueurs called green chartreuse, introduced in 1764.</p>

<p>Etymology</p>

<p>The French word chartreuse means "charter house". The monasteries that the monks of the Carthusian order <br>
    (who started producing Chartreuse liqueur in 1764) live in, the first one of which was established in 1082 by Saint <br>
    Bruno, are called charter houses because they were chartered—and given generous material support—by the <br>
    Duke of Burgundy known as Philip the Bold when he took over the area in 1378. Philip the Bold's elaborately <br>
    decorated tomb was initially installed at a Carthusian charter house when he died in 1404.</p>
