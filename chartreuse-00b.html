    <p>Chartreuse is a color midway between yellow & green that was named due of its resemblance to <br> 
    the green color of one of the French liqueurs called green chartreuse, introduced in 1764.</p>

<h2>Etymology</h2>

    <p>The French word chartreuse means "charter house". The monasteries that the monks of the <br> 
    Carthusian order (who started producing Chartreuse liqueur in 1764) live in, the first one of which <br> 
    was established in 1082 by Saint Bruno, are called charter houses because they were chartered — <br> 
    and given generous material support—by the Duke of Burgundy known as Philip the Bold when he <br> 
    took over the area in 1378. Philip the Bold's elaborately decorated tomb was initially installed at a <br> 
    Carthusian charter house when he died in 1404.</p>
